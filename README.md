## Description
You're planning a surprise birthday party for a friend who loves escape rooms and puzzles. What better way to practice your new coding skills than to build an application that will help you encode and decode all kinds of fun messages?

## Objectives
This project is designed to test the ability to build complex algorithms. It will also test the ability to write unit tests with Mocha and Chai to test your algorithms.

## Tools Used:
JavaScript

---
This project is still in progress. I am working on the Polybius Square and Substitution cipher side of this project.
